# Written description of three observable trends based on the data.

### 1. Bubble Plot Trend Observations

a)Total number of rides in urban cities are higher than total number of rides in suburban cities, which is in turn higher than rural cities. Similarly, total number of drivers in urban cities are higher than total number of drivers in suburban cities, which is again in turn higher than rural cities. Thereby, we conclude that total number of rides per city type directly correlates with total number of drivers per city type with a few exceptions.

b)Average fare for suburban and rural cities falls between $30 to $35 whereas average fare for urban cities falls between $20 to $25. As a result, we conclude that on an average, rides in urban cities are less expensive than rides in suburban and rural cities.

c)We can also infer that average fares per city type inversely correlates with total number of drivers per city type.

### 2. Pie Chart Trend observations

From the pie charts, we infer that the company gets more revenue from urban cities than suburban and rural cities. We also infer that total number of rides and drivers in the three city types follow a similar trend to total revenue. The company may benefit from focusing on suburban and rural cities to sustain future revenue growth.
